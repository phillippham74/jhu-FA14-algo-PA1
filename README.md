Programming Assignment #1

INPUT:
    1.) data/small_input.txt
    2.) data/ProgrammingAssignmentsGuidelines.txt



TO RUN:
    Run the program with "python src/ArraySet.py -i <inputfile> -q <queryelement>",
    where the <inputfile> is the path to the elements to add to the ArraySet,
    and <queryelement> is the element to query for after the ArraySet has been
    populated from the values in the inputfile. To turn on the trace, add
    a '-v' flag to print out the logs to standard output. For help with the
    options, you can run the code with  -h. For example,
    "python src/ArraySet.py --help"

TRACE:
    1.) Trace for first input data can be found in: logs/small_input_trace.log
    2.) Trace for second input data set can be found in: logs/ProgrammingAssignmentsGuidelines_trace.log

OUTPUTS:
    The program will output "Element <queryelement> exists? <boolean>", where
    the <queryelement> is the element that was inputted with -q flag, and boolean
    is whether or not the element was found in the ArraySet

SAMPLE OUTPUTS:
    1.) Sample output for first input data can be found in: 
        logs/small_input_output.log
    2.) Trace for second input data set can be found in: 
        logs/ProgrammingAssignmentsGuidelines_output.log
